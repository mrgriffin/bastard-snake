- Entity.onRemove?
- OnEdge event?  Edge pseudo-Entity?  Torus Room-s?  Have Room-s be 2 cells bigger than viewport, and put UnidirectionalPortal-s on the edges?
- Do we need to maintain a list of Cell-s in Room?
- Throw RangeError if an Entity goes out of bounds of a Room
- Add dependency system
- Highscore mechanism
- Lift Action.apply to Game?  Remove snake.crashed and replace with Snake.CrashedAction
- Action examples?
- Make Room.add private and have Game.add(Entity, Room)
- Note that Entity.onX should not be called from user code
- Probably a code smell if we have a function /statement/ in our code (not hiding as well as we could)
- Refactor Tail so it does not need to know its head
